# PoseMaster: A Real-Time Posture Detection System

Welcome to **PoseMaster**, a real-time posture detection system built with PoseNet and p5.js!

## About The Project 📽️

**PoseMaster** is a web-based application that uses PoseNet, a machine learning model, to estimate human poses in real-time from a webcam video stream. It's perfect for developers and researchers who are interested in integrating pose detection into their projects or applications.

## Features 🌟

- **Real-Time Pose Detection**: PoseMaster can detect 17 key points on the body in real-time.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: The detected key points and skeletal structure are visualized on the video stream for an interactive experience.
- **Easy to Use**: PoseMaster is easy to set up and use. All you need is a webcam and a modern web browser.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A webcam

### Installation

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your_username_/PoseMaster.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage 💡

Once you've opened `index.html` in your web browser, allow the website to access your webcam. Stand back so that your full body is visible in the webcam feed. PoseMaster will start detecting your pose in real-time!

## Built With 🛠️

- PoseNet: A machine learning model that allows for real-time human pose estimation in the browser.
